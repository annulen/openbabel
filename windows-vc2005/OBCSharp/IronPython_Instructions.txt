=== How to use OBDotNet from IronPython ===

If running IronPython in the unzipped OBDotNet folder, you can use the following to initialise OBDotNet:

>>> import clr
>>> clr.AddReference("OBDotNet")

Otherwise, you need to need to:
  (1) add the OBDotNet distribution folder to the PATH environment variable
  (2) include the full path to the OBDotNet.dll when adding the reference, as follows (note the 'r' at the start):

>>> import clr
>>> clr.AddReferenceToFileAndPath(r"C:\Tools\OpenBabel\ob-22x\windows-vc2005\OBCSharp\OBDotNet-0.1\OBDotNet.dll")

Once the reference to OBDotNet has been added, you can import and use the OpenBabel bindings just like from CPython:

>>> import OpenBabel as ob
>>> conv = ob.OBConversion()
>>> conv.SetInFormat("smi")
True
>>> mol = ob.OBMol()
>>> conv.ReadString(mol, "CCC")
True
>>> mol.GetMolWt()
